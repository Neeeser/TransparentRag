# Ragworks

Ragworks is a FastAPI backend (`app/`) with a Next.js frontend (`frontend/`) — an
easy-to-use RAG interface for power users. Its backbones are pluggable vector stores
(pgvector in the shipped Postgres by default, Pinecone optionally) and pluggable
model providers behind per-user connections (OpenRouter and Ollama today, embeddings
+ chat), mixable per pipeline and per chat session.

This file holds only repo-wide rules. Area rules live next to the code they govern —
load the one for the code you're touching; area files extend these rules, they never
replace them:

- Backend (`app/`): @app/AGENTS.md
- Frontend (`frontend/`): @frontend/AGENTS.md

# Verify gates

Nothing ships without its gate passing. Run the gate for every area you changed:

- Backend: `make verify` (typecheck → lint → test), plus `make coverage` (review
  `term-missing`)
- Frontend: `npm run verify` in `frontend/` (typecheck → lint → tests), plus
  `make format-check-frontend`

If you only changed one side, only that side's gate is required. CI (`ci.yml`) runs
both gates (plus a frontend `npm run build`) on every PR and push to `main`.

# Bug fixes require a regression test

Whenever a bug is fixed, a regression test must be written alongside the fix, **in the
same commit** — verified red-green: run the test without the fix and watch it fail for
the bug's reason, then apply the fix and watch it pass. This is how the test suite
grows: on things we know were broken, not on coverage padding. A bug fix PR with no
failing-then-passing test is incomplete.

# Commits

- Subjects are conventional-commit style with a scope: `type(scope): summary`, e.g.
  `feat(pipelines): …`, `fix(ui): …`, `test(chat): …`, `docs: …`. Types: `feat`,
  `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`. The scope names the feature area
  or subsystem that changed, lowercase; omit it only when nothing narrower than the
  whole repo fits (`docs: …`).
- Never use the `!` breaking marker (`feat!:`) — breaking changes are flagged with
  the `breaking` PR label, which is what release notes are built from.
- Imperative mood, no trailing period, ≤72 characters. Add a body when the *why*
  isn't obvious from the subject.
- Commit as you go on a branch: small, coherent commits per logical step — never one
  squashed mega-commit at the end of the work.
- A bug fix and its regression test share one commit (see above).

# Pull requests

- Work on a branch; merge to `main` via PR. Keep PRs to one concern.
- The PR title follows the commit-subject convention. The description states what
  changed, why, and how it was verified (name the gates you ran), and links the
  issue (`Refs #N` / `Closes #N`).
- If a change spans the API contract (backend schemas + frontend types), update both
  sides in the same PR so they can't drift — and say so in the description. Same for
  the `docker-compose.yml` ↔ README mirror (below).
- Every PR carries at least one release-notes label (`breaking`, `feature`, `fix`,
  `docs`, `ci`, `dependencies`, `chore`, or `skip-changelog`) — the `PR labels` check
  fails without one, and `.github/release.yml` uses them to organize release notes.

# Releases

Docker is the release vehicle, and releases go through a **release PR** — never a
push straight to `main`, and never a hand-created tag. `make
bump-patch|bump-minor|bump-major` (pre-releases: `make bump-rc`, SemVer `-rc.N`), or
the **Open release PR** workflow-dispatch button, runs `scripts/bump_version.py`: it
bumps the version on a `release/v<version>` branch and opens a PR — it does **not**
push to `main` or create the tag. Merging that PR fires `release.yml`, which tags the
merge commit, publishes multi-arch `ghcr.io/neeeser/ragworks-backend` / `-frontend`
images (`X.Y.Z` + `X.Y` + `latest` for stable, `X.Y.Z-rc.N` alone for pre-releases),
and cuts the GitHub Release with label-organized notes. The version lives in
`pyproject.toml` and `frontend/package.json` (plus lockfiles); only
`scripts/bump_version.py` writes it. Every push to `main` publishes rolling `edge`
images (`edge.yml`) for testing — never a release. The multi-arch build is one
reusable workflow (`build-images.yml`) shared by `release.yml` and `edge.yml`.

The shipped `docker-compose.yml` is deliberately minimal and self-contained: no
`.env` file, no required edits, `latest` image tags, hardcoded network-internal
Postgres password, host port `7247`. The JWT signing secret is auto-generated on
first boot and persisted in the `backend-config` volume — separate from the bulk
`document-storage` volume so reclaiming space never rotates it; setting
`JWT_SECRET_KEY` overrides it. **The README quick-start Compose block is a
byte-for-byte mirror of `docker-compose.yml` — any change to either updates both in
the same PR.** The frontend image is built without `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and
proxies same-origin `/api/*` calls via the runtime `API_PROXY_TARGET` middleware
(`frontend/src/middleware.ts`) — a build-time `rewrites()` in `next.config.ts` can't
see an env var set when the container starts.

# Configuration architecture

The project is heading toward being fully config-driven (runtime-editable settings,
feature flags, defaults). The layering is settled — build toward it, don't drift:

- **Layer 1 — bootstrap/infrastructure: environment variables.** Only what the
  process needs before it can serve, or what binds it to infrastructure:
  `DATABASE_URL`, `FILE_STORAGE_PATH`, `CONFIG_PATH`, `DEBUG`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
  (optional override), ports. Not runtime-editable. Never grow this layer with
  application-behavior settings.
- **Layer 2 — runtime application config: Postgres (`app_settings` table).**
  `AppConfig` (`app/schemas/app_config.py`) is the single source of truth for code
  defaults and the field catalog the admin UI renders from. The sparse
  `app_settings` table stores overrides only; `AppConfigService.effective_config()`
  merges env-pinned → DB override → code default. `GET /api/config` serves the
  public subset unauthenticated; `GET/PATCH /api/admin/config` (admin-gated)
  serve/edit the full catalog. Never introduce file-based runtime config (a
  config.yaml in a volume) — the DB is the config store. **There are no global
  default models** — shipped model ids rot as providers deprecate them (a hardcoded
  default once 502'd every first upload). Model choices are always explicit
  `(provider connection, model)` pairs; default-pipeline scaffolding raises a clear
  `InvalidInputError` when no defaults exist yet.
- **Layer 3 — per-user settings** (provider connections, session preferences) —
  stays per-user, never migrates into global config. Provider credentials live on
  the `provider_connections` table (one row per configured provider instance),
  never as columns on `User`.
- **The frontend is an API client, never a config owner.** Frontend-related settings
  are fields in the central config fetched over the API. The frontend container
  mounts no volumes and reads no config files; sharing a volume between frontend and
  backend is an anti-pattern (two writers, no validation, secret exposure).
- **The `backend-config` volume (`CONFIG_PATH`) is *not* the central config store**:
  it holds only machine-generated state that must exist before the DB is reachable
  (today: the auto-generated JWT secret). One volume, one writer.

# Cross-cutting constraints

- **External API changes (Pinecone, OpenRouter):** read the locally downloaded docs
  in `docs/external-api/{pinecone,openrouter}/` first — they reflect the versions we
  actually run against; trust them over memory. They're gitignored, so in a fresh
  worktree fetch them first: `node scripts/download-openrouter-docs.mjs` /
  `node scripts/download-pinecone-docs.mjs`.
- **The wire contract is defined once, in `app/schemas/`.** Frontend types in
  `frontend/src/lib/types/` hand-mirror them; when a schema changes, the mirror
  changes in the same PR.
- **Chat parameter keys are matched exact-case** (`app/schemas/chat_parameters.py`):
  `ChatParameters` ignores unknown keys and `ProviderPreferences` normalizes only a
  small alias set — a deliberate narrowing from an old case-insensitive sanitizer.
  Send canonical snake_case keys.

# README style and maintenance

- Write for self-hosters first, in concise factual language. Keep the project
  identity provider-neutral; name supported providers only where setup requires it.
- Restrained visuals: one short tagline, a curated row of stable badges, sparing
  emoji. No badge walls, inflated claims, volatile metrics, or roadmap checklists.
  Link to canonical docs instead of duplicating details that change frequently.
- Keep the README Compose block byte-for-byte identical to `docker-compose.yml`;
  keep the YAML free of comments and put operational context in surrounding prose.
- Run `make readme-assets` whenever default pipeline definitions or their rendered
  components change (requires Playwright Chromium, `ffmpeg`, `gifski`); commit the
  regenerated light/dark animations and posters, keep each GIF ≥1440px wide and
  under its 8 MB guard, and inspect first/last frames of each scene in both themes.
  Verify README links, commands, and factual claims with every update.

# Make commands

- `make env`: install backend deps via `uv` and frontend deps via `npm`
- `make server` / `make frontend` / `make run`: run backend, frontend, or both (dev)
- `make verify`: the backend gate — typecheck → lint → test
- `make test` / `make test-frontend`: backend (pytest) / frontend (vitest) tests
- `make coverage` / `make coverage-frontend`: coverage runs (fail on test failure);
  `-report` variants are non-blocking, `-open` variants open the HTML report
- `make typecheck`: `mypy app` (strict); `make lint`: ruff + pylint on `app/`
- `make lint-frontend` / `make format-frontend` / `make format-check-frontend`:
  ESLint / Prettier write / Prettier check on `frontend/`
- `make readme-assets`: regenerate the README pipeline animations and posters
- `make bump-patch|bump-minor|bump-major|bump-rc`: open a release PR (see Releases —
  these never push to `main` or create tags themselves)

# Maintaining these AGENTS.md files

These files are lessons learned about writing good, consistent code in this repo.
When a fix, incident, or review teaches a durable rule, add it to the relevant
AGENTS.md **in the same PR** — never batched later. A rule earns its place by
capturing a non-obvious repo invariant or a proven failure mode; write it as a
concise imperative plus one line of why (the failure it prevents). Put it in the
narrowest file where it always applies. Don't add generic language advice, transient
feature status, or facts easily discovered from the code — known gaps and tech debt
become GitHub issues, not AGENTS.md sections. Prune rules when the architecture or
enforcement that motivated them changes.
