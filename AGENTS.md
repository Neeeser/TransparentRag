# Ragworks

Ragworks is a FastAPI backend (`app/`) with a Next.js frontend (`frontend/`).
The goal is an easy-to-use RAG interface for power users. Its backbones are pluggable
vector stores — pgvector in the shipped Postgres by default, Pinecone optionally —
and pluggable model providers behind per-user connections: OpenRouter and Ollama
today (embeddings + chat), mixable per pipeline and per chat session.

This file holds only repo-wide rules. Area-specific engineering practices live next to
the code they govern — load the one for the code you're touching:

- Backend (`app/`): @app/AGENTS.md
- Frontend (`frontend/`): @frontend/AGENTS.md

# Verify gates

Nothing ships without its gate passing. Run the gate for every area you changed:

- Backend: `make verify` (typecheck → lint → test), plus `make coverage` (review
  `term-missing`)
- Frontend: `npm run verify` in `frontend/` (typecheck → lint → tests), plus
  `make format-check-frontend`

If you only changed one side, only that side's gate is required.

# Bug fixes require a regression test

Whenever a bug is fixed, a regression test must be written alongside the fix, **in the
same commit** — verified red-green: run the test without the fix and watch it fail for
the bug's reason, then apply the fix and watch it pass. This is how the test suite
grows: on things we know were broken, not on coverage padding. A bug fix PR with no
failing-then-passing test is incomplete.

# Commit and PR conventions

- Conventional-commit style subjects, scoped: `feat(pipelines): …`, `fix(ui): …`,
  `test(chat): …`, `docs: …`.
- Work on a branch; merge to `main` via PR. Keep PRs to one concern.
- If a change spans the API contract (backend schemas + frontend types), update both
  sides in the same PR so they can't drift.
- Every PR carries at least one release-notes label (`breaking`, `feature`, `fix`,
  `docs`, `ci`, `dependencies`, `chore`, or `skip-changelog`) — the `PR labels` check
  fails without one, and `.github/release.yml` uses them to organize release notes.

# Releases

Docker is the release vehicle, and releases go through a **release PR** — never a
push straight to `main`. `make bump-patch|bump-minor|bump-major` (pre-releases:
`make bump-rc`, SemVer `-rc.N`), or the **Open release PR** workflow-dispatch
button, runs `scripts/bump_version.py`: it bumps the version on a
`release/v<version>` branch and opens a PR (it does not push to `main` or create
the tag). Merging that PR fires the Release workflow (`release.yml`, triggered by
the release PR merging), which tags the merge commit, publishes multi-arch
`ghcr.io/neeeser/ragworks-backend` / `-frontend` images (`X.Y.Z` + `X.Y` +
`latest` for stable, `X.Y.Z-rc.N` alone for pre-releases), and cuts the GitHub
Release with label-organized notes (`.github/release.yml`) and
`docker-compose.yml` attached. The version lives in `pyproject.toml` and
`frontend/package.json` (plus the lockfiles); only `scripts/bump_version.py`
writes it. Because the tag is created by the workflow, a failed build leaves no
dangling tag, and because the release commit already passed CI on the PR, the
release path never re-runs the verify gate. The multi-arch build itself is one
reusable workflow (`build-images.yml`) shared by `release.yml` and `edge.yml`, so
the build definition has a single home. Every push to `main` publishes rolling
`edge` images (`edge.yml`) for testing main — never a release; the release commit
is skipped there since `release.yml` gives it versioned images instead. `ci.yml`
(verify: typecheck → lint → test) runs on every pull request and every push to
`main`, so the verify gate follows the normal commit pattern and gates the
release PR like any other.

The shipped `docker-compose.yml` is deliberately minimal and self-contained: no
`.env` file, no required edits, `latest` image tags, hardcoded network-internal
Postgres password, host port `7247`. The JWT signing secret is auto-generated on
first boot and persisted in the `backend-config` volume — separate from the bulk
`document-storage` volume so reclaiming space never rotates it (`get_settings` in
`app/core/config.py`); setting `JWT_SECRET_KEY` overrides it. The exact same YAML
is pasted into README.md's quick start — **any change to `docker-compose.yml`
updates the README block (and vice versa) in the same PR; they are mirror copies.** The frontend Docker image is built without
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and proxies same-origin `/api/*` calls to the backend via
the runtime `API_PROXY_TARGET` proxy in `frontend/src/middleware.ts` (a Next.js
`rewrites()` in `next.config.ts` is baked into the build-time routes manifest and
can't see an env var set when the container starts — middleware runs per request
instead).

# Configuration architecture

The project is heading toward being fully config-driven (runtime-editable settings,
beta/feature flags, defaults). The layering below is settled — build toward it, don't
drift from it:

- **Layer 1 — bootstrap/infrastructure: environment variables.** Only what the process
  needs before it can serve, or what binds it to infrastructure: `DATABASE_URL`,
  `FILE_STORAGE_PATH`, `CONFIG_PATH`, `DEBUG`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (optional override),
  ports. Not runtime-editable. Never grow this layer with application behavior
  settings.
- **Layer 2 — runtime application config: Postgres (`app_settings` table).**
  The central, UI-editable config is `AppConfig` (`app/schemas/app_config.py`), the
  single source of truth for both code defaults and the field catalog the admin UI
  renders from — one section model per concern today (`auth`, `uploads`,
  `indexing`, `features`, `telemetry`). The sparse `app_settings` table stores
  overrides only, keyed by dotted field name; `AppConfigService.effective_config()`
  merges precedence env-pinned → DB override → code default. `GET /api/config`
  serves the public subset (`PublicConfig`) unauthenticated; `GET /api/admin/config`
  and `PATCH /api/admin/config` (admin-gated) serve/edit the full field catalog. Do
  **not** introduce file-based runtime config (config.yaml in a volume) — the DB is
  the config store. **There are no global default models** — a `models` section
  once existed and was removed because shipped model ids rot as providers
  deprecate them (a hardcoded default once 502'd every first upload). Model
  choices are always explicit `(provider connection, model)` pairs: the setup
  wizard's confirmed pick lands inside the scaffolded pipeline definitions, chat
  seeds from the user's sticky last-used model, and default-pipeline scaffolding
  raises a clear `InvalidInputError` when no defaults exist yet.
- **Layer 3 — per-user settings** (provider connections, session preferences) —
  already exists; stays per-user, never migrates into global config. Provider
  credentials live on the `provider_connections` table (one row per configured
  provider instance: an OpenRouter account, an Ollama server URL, a Pinecone
  project), never as columns on `User`.
- **The frontend is an API client, never a config owner.** Frontend-related settings
  are fields in the central config fetched over the API. The frontend container mounts
  no volumes and reads no config files; sharing a volume between frontend and backend
  is an anti-pattern (two writers, no validation, file-level secret exposure).
- **The `backend-config` volume (`CONFIG_PATH`) is *not* the central config store** and
  must stay narrow: machine-generated state that must exist before the DB is reachable
  (today: the auto-generated JWT secret). It is named after its single owning service
  on purpose — one volume, one writer.

# Cross-cutting constraints

- **External API changes (Pinecone, OpenRouter):** read the locally downloaded docs in
  `docs/external-api/pinecone/` and
  `docs/external-api/openrouter/` first — they reflect the versions we
  actually run against; trust them over memory. (Gitignored — fetch with
  `node scripts/download-openrouter-docs.mjs` / `node scripts/download-pinecone-docs.mjs`.)
- **The wire contract is defined once, in `app/schemas/`.** Frontend types in
  `frontend/src/lib/types/` hand-mirror them; when a schema changes, the mirror changes
  in the same PR.
- **Chat parameter keys are matched exact-case since the typed models
  (`app/schemas/chat_parameters.py`).** `ChatParameters` ignores unknown keys and
  `ProviderPreferences` only normalizes a small alias set — a deliberate narrowing from
  the old case-insensitive hand-rolled sanitizer; send canonical snake_case keys.
- **Docs are updated incrementally.** When a fix or incident teaches a rule, add it to
  the relevant AGENTS.md in that same PR — never batched later.

# README style and maintenance

- Write for self-hosters first in concise, factual language. Keep the project identity
  provider-neutral; name currently supported providers only where the setup requires it.
- A centered header may use one short tagline, a curated row of stable project/technology
  badges, and section navigation. Use emoji sparingly in section headings, or inline only
  when one materially improves understanding; do not decorate every heading or list item.
  Avoid oversized badge walls, inflated claims, volatile metrics, and roadmap checklists.
  Link to canonical development or release documentation instead of duplicating details
  that change frequently.
- Keep the README Compose block byte-for-byte identical to `docker-compose.yml`. Keep the
  YAML free of explanatory comments and put operational context in the surrounding prose.
- Run `make readme-assets` whenever default pipeline definitions or their rendered
  components change, then commit the generated light/dark animations and posters. The
  capture requires Playwright Chromium, `ffmpeg`, and `gifski`. Keep each GIF at least
  1440px wide and below its 8 MB guard, crop excess canvas, and inspect the first and last
  frame of each scene in both themes for one complete non-looping run. Check node-text
  legibility at README display size. Verify README links, commands, release references,
  and factual claims with every update.
