/**
 * The hero's signature: synthetic RAG pipelines running continuously behind
 * the headline, rotating Factorio-intro style through the scene registry
 * (semantic and hybrid, ingestion and retrieval). Each scene plays through
 * the *same* `FlowPlayer` the trace viewer uses, so the backdrop stays
 * visually in lockstep with the product — but fed hand-authored, in-memory
 * data (no telemetry, no traces, no network). Purely decorative:
 * non-interactive, aria-hidden, faded at the edges so it never competes with
 * the copy on top. Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the first scene renders
 * statically and the rotation never starts.
