# Frontend Engineering Practices

Rules for working in `frontend/`. Every rule here exists because we found and fixed the
opposite in this codebase — don't reintroduce it. The core idea throughout: **small,
component-driven, well-named files that one person can hold in their head at once.**

## Code structure

- **File size is a design signal.** Components and hooks stay under ~300 lines; 400 is the
  hard lint ceiling (tests exempt). If a file approaches the limit, it has more than one
  responsibility — split it. We once had a 3,143-line component with 55 `useState` calls;
  never again.
- **One responsibility per file.** A component renders; a hook owns one state domain; a
  `*-utils.ts` module holds pure functions. If you can't name the file after its single
  job, it has more than one.
- **Logic lives in hooks, not components.** When a component accumulates fetch effects,
  handler groups, or derived-state chains, extract a custom hook per state domain
  (`useModelCatalog`, `usePineconeIndexes`, …). The component composes hooks and renders.
- **Reducers over state constellations.** More than ~5 related `useState` calls that
  update together, or any ref that exists only to mirror state for closures, means the
  state has outgrown `useState` — use `useReducer` with named actions. Copy-pasting a
  "reset all these states" block is the classic symptom (we had the same reset block
  pasted three times; a reducer `RESET` action replaced it).
- **Pages are thin shells.** Route files under `app/` delegate to components/hooks; no
  business logic, no fetch orchestration in a `page.tsx`.
- **Delete dead code on sight.** No-op callbacks drilled through props, re-export blocks
  "for convenience", helpers that wrap a single operator — remove them. Dead code is not
  harmless; it costs every future reader.

## Duplication

- **Second copy = extract.** The moment you paste a function, class-string, constant, or
  JSX block into a second file, stop and extract it to the shared layer it belongs to
  (`lib/`, `components/ui/`, or the feature's `*-utils.ts`). We removed a 62-line
  function that had been duplicated verbatim across two files, and an input class string
  copied 29 times.
- **Derive, don't duplicate types.** When one type is a subset/variant of another, derive
  it (`Extract<...>`, `Omit<...>`, `Pick<...>`) instead of maintaining a parallel
  interface that will drift.
- **Constants are defined once.** Sentinel strings (`"__create__"`), size constants, and
  default flags live in one exported constant; a second definition that "must stay in
  sync" with the first is a latent bug.

## TypeScript

- **`npm run typecheck` must exit 0 before every commit.** It is part of the verify
  chain (`typecheck && vitest run && lint`). This codebase once accumulated 227 unnoticed
  errors because no gate existed; one of them was a shipped runtime crash.
- **Never suppress:** no `any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no `@ts-expect-error` in source. Fix the
  type. An `as` cast is a last resort for invariants the type system can't express — keep
  it local and comment why.
- **Narrow, don't cast.** Use type guards (`typeof x === "number"`, `"field" in obj`,
  discriminant checks) to handle unions. Casting through `unknown` in source code hides
  real mismatches.
- **Learn the library's generics.** `@xyflow/react` v12 takes the full node type
  (`NodeProps<Node<PipelineNodeData>>`), not the data type; `new Map(entries)` needs
  `[K, V]` tuples, not `string[][]`. When a library upgrade changes generics, fix the
  usage — don't cast around it.
- **Types are organized by domain** in `src/lib/types/{common,collections,chat,pipelines,traces}.ts`
  with an `index.ts` barrel (`@/lib/types` keeps working). Add new wire types to the right
  domain file. These hand-mirror the FastAPI schemas; if a shape is uncertain, check the
  backend schema instead of adding a `[key: string]: unknown` escape hatch. (Future work:
  generate these from `/openapi.json` via `openapi-typescript`.)

## API layer

- **Every network call goes through `src/lib/api/`** — domain modules
  (`auth/collections/pipelines/chat/models`) behind the `@/lib/api` barrel, all funneling
  through `apiFetch` in `client.ts`. No stray `fetch()` outside this layer.
- **`token` is always the first parameter** of an authed API function. Mixed orders
  (`(id, token)` vs `(token, id)`) with same-typed adjacent params produce swaps the
  compiler can't catch.
- **Errors are typed.** `apiFetch` throws `ApiError { status, detail }`
  (`src/lib/api-error.ts`); use `isUnauthorized(err)` for 401 handling and
  `getErrorMessage(err, fallback)` (`src/lib/errors.ts`) to display messages. Never write
  the `err instanceof Error ? err.message : "…"` ternary inline — it was copy-pasted 46
  times before we centralized it.
- **`"use client"` belongs on components/hooks only** — never on plain `lib/` modules; it
  forecloses server-side use for no benefit.

## Data fetching in components

- **Use `useApiQuery(fn, deps)`** (`src/lib/use-api-query.ts`) for load-on-mount /
  reload-on-change data. It owns the loading/error/cancellation lifecycle. Do not
  hand-roll the `useEffect` + `let cancelled = false` + `setLoading/setError/setData`
  dance — it existed 18 times, and the copies that forgot the `cancelled` guard were
  race bugs.
- **Never swallow a fetch error.** Every failure surfaces to the user through the
  component's error channel (message state, notice banner). A `.catch` that only flips a
  boolean, or a `try/finally` with no `catch`, is a bug we've had to fix — twice.

## UI primitives — use them, don't re-roll them

- **Every overlay is `ModalOverlay`** (`components/ui/modal-overlay.tsx`). Never hand-roll
  a `fixed inset-0 z-50` div: we had five of them, each with different Escape/backdrop/
  focus behavior and half without `role="dialog"`. ModalOverlay owns Escape-to-close,
  backdrop click, focus-into-dialog, focus restore, Tab containment, scroll lock, and
  ARIA wiring. Dialogs pass `labelledBy` pointing at their title element.
- **Every form control goes through `Field`/`TextInput`/`Select`/`TextArea`**
  (`components/ui/field.tsx`). Field wires `htmlFor`/`id` via `useId` and `aria-describedby`
  for hint/error text. The canonical input styling lives in the exported `inputClass`
  constant — the raw class string was once copy-pasted 29 times; if you type
  `rounded-2xl border border-white/10` by hand into a form control, stop.
- **Confirmations use `ConfirmDialog`**, including destructive type-to-confirm flows via
  its `confirmText` prop — don't build bespoke nested delete modals.
- **Wizards use `WizardShell` + `WizardFooter`** — the Back/Next/Cancel cluster is one
  component, not per-wizard JSX.
- **`Button loading` keeps its children visible** (spinner + `aria-busy` + disabled).
  Never swap button content for placeholder text; it causes layout shift and breaks
  accessible names.
- **`cn` resolves Tailwind conflicts via `tailwind-merge`** — a later class deterministically
  wins over an earlier conflicting one. Don't rely on stylesheet order, and don't use `cn`
  for non-class strings (e.g. joining ARIA id lists — use a plain join).
- **Accessibility is part of done**, not polish: interactive elements need accessible
  names (`aria-label` on icon buttons), labels need `htmlFor`, expanded/collapsed state
  needs `aria-expanded`, and anything keyboard-reachable must actually work with a
  keyboard (test with `user-event`, not `fireEvent`, when focus/keyboard semantics matter).

## Logging & debug artifacts

- **No `console.log`/`console.debug` in committed code.** `console.warn`/`console.error`
  only, for genuinely exceptional situations. Production builds strip the rest via
  `compiler.removeConsole`, and lint forbids them — but don't rely on the safety net.
  Never write a `useEffect` whose only job is logging (we shipped one that re-ran on
  every streamed token).

## Environment

- **Node version is pinned** (`.nvmrc`, `engines` in package.json). Node ≥22.4's built-in
  `localStorage` shadows jsdom's in Vitest — `src/test/setup.ts` stubs Web Storage with an
  in-memory implementation. If storage-related tests fail mysteriously, check Node
  version drift first.

## Testing

- **Tests assert behavior, not wiring.** A test must be able to FAIL when the behavior it
  names breaks. Before trusting a test, mutation-check it mentally (or actually): "if I
  deleted the code under test, would this fail?" We deleted a test whose only assertion
  could never fire under React 19 — a test that can't fail is worse than no test.
- **Never write these:**
  - Tests that invoke a captured callback prop and assert nothing about the outcome.
  - `expect(x).toEqual(expect.any(Object))` — asserts existence, not behavior.
  - Tests of barrel files ("re-exports are defined") — pure coverage padding.
  - Snapshot-style class-name assertions (`querySelector("div.scroll-smooth")`) when a
    role/text query exists.
- **Coverage is a floor, not a goal.** We deliberately lowered thresholds; a smaller
  suite of diagnostic tests beats a large suite of wiring tests that must be updated on
  every refactor and catch nothing. Never add a test just to make a percentage move.
- **Prefer accessible queries** (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText`) and
  `@testing-library/user-event` for interactions where keyboard/focus semantics matter.
- **Async state updates resolve inside `await act(async () => …)`.** Resolving a promise
  outside `act` can make an assertion pass vacuously because the re-render never
  committed — we found a "stale response ignored" test that passed even with the guard
  deleted for exactly this reason.
- **Giant test files mirror giant components.** If a component's test needs to mock every
  child and capture their props to be testable, the component is too big — decompose the
  component instead of growing the test.
