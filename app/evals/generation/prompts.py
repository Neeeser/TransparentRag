"""Prompt and response-schema builders for synthetic generation and critique.

Plain functions returning chat messages plus the `response_format` JSON
schemas the calls are made with. The prompts encode the research-backed
guardrails: a verbatim quote requirement (mechanical groundedness),
distractor conditioning (questions only the target context answers),
type-specific instructions (paraphrased questions avoid the source's
wording), and optional audience/example steering toward realistic usage.
Output shape is enforced by the provider's structured-outputs feature, never
by prompt formatting alone — the in-prompt shape line is only the safety net
for providers that ignore `response_format`.
