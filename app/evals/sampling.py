"""Deterministic corpus sampling for an eval run.

Sampling is by query. The sampled corpus is every gold document for the sampled
queries (always included, so no query is made unanswerable) plus a random pool of
distractor documents that controls corpus scale and difficulty. A fixed seed makes
the whole plan reproducible, and the corpus hash content-addresses the sampled
corpus so an eval collection can be reused across retrieval pipelines that share
the same ingestion pipeline.
