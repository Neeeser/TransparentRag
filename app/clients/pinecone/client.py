Behavior here is pinned to the installed SDK (`pinecone==8.0.0`, per `uv.lock`) --
verified by reading `external_api_documentation/pinecone-docs/reference/python-sdk.md`
and by introspecting the installed package directly, not by feature-detecting at
runtime. See `app/AGENTS.md` for the resulting rule.
