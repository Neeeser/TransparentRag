"""Adapter construction: the single place provider adapters are built.

`get_provider` is also the single enforcement point for provider
prerequisites: an unknown provider type, malformed config, or a kind the
provider doesn't serve raises `InvalidInputError` (→ 400), and a connection
that doesn't exist for the user raises `NotFoundError` (→ 404).
`ProviderResolver` wraps it lazily for pipeline runs and chat turns so a run
only constructs the adapters it actually touches.
