"""In-memory ring buffer of recent log records for diagnostics export.

A fixed-size, thread-safe, process-lifetime store of already-redacted event
dicts. It powers the admin "Download diagnostics" bundle without introducing
an application-managed log file: the durable history is the stdout stream the
container operator collects, and this buffer is the recent tail an operator can
export from the UI. It sits *after* redaction in the logging pipeline, so an
export can never contain anything stdout could not.

Restart-scoped by design — a process crash loses the buffer, but ``docker
logs`` still holds the stdout tail up to the crash.
