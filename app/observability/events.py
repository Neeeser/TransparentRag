"""Event vocabulary for structured logging.

The single entry point services and clients use is ``get_logger``. Event names
passed to it are stable, dotted, past-tense facts — ``domain.action[.outcome]``
— and identifiers travel as structured keyword fields, never interpolated into
the message string. The constants below are the canonical names for the
high-value flows instrumented across the app; new call sites either reuse one
of these or follow the same ``domain.action.outcome`` shape.
