"""Typed SSE stream events — the wire contract for `/api/chat/stream`.

Each model's field order matches its historical dict literal exactly
(`model_dump()` preserves declaration order), so serializing an event model
through the same `jsonable_encoder` + `json.dumps` pipeline the route already
uses (`app/api/routes/chat.py::format_event`) produces byte-identical SSE
frames to the pre-4.1 dict-based events. See
`tests/api/test_chat_stream_events.py` for the byte-identity guard.

`TokenEvent`/`ReasoningEvent` are defined here as the formal contract but are
still constructed as plain dicts in `app/chat/streaming/streaming.py` —
that generator is exercised directly by a large, deliberately
garbage-tolerant test suite (`tests/services/chat/test_chat_streaming.py`,
`tests/services/chat/test_chat_service_coverage.py::test_stream_iteration_skips_invalid_event_shapes`)
that depends on malformed/partial event dicts passing through unchanged.
Validating every event at that point would be a real (out-of-scope)
behavior change; `ChatService` forwards those dicts unmodified today, and
they already conform to this contract's shape. `ToolCallEvent`/
`ToolResultEvent`/`FinalEvent`/`ErrorEvent` are constructed directly at
their single origination points (`app/chat/service.py`,
`app/api/routes/chat.py`), since those sites build the event fresh rather
than forwarding one.
