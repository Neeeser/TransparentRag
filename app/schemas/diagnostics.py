"""Wire contract for collection-level diagnostics.

A collection binds an ingestion pipeline and a retrieval pipeline; those two
(plus the indexed data they share) can drift into configurations that make
search empty, misleading, or broken while every individual pipeline still
validates. Diagnostics is the cross-pipeline surface that points such
configurations out without blocking them -- Ragworks is an experiment
workbench, so odd setups stay allowed, they are only flagged.

Every finding is a `CollectionDiagnostic` produced by a registered rule
(`app/services/diagnostics/rules/`); there are no one-off warning strings.
This module owns the wire shape and is hand-mirrored to
`frontend/src/lib/types/diagnostics.ts` in the same PR.
