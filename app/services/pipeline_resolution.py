"""The one place that resolves a collection's pipeline bindings.

Every caller that needs a collection's active pipelines follows the same
sequence: ensure default pipelines exist for the user, bind them to the
collection if it has no bindings yet, load the bound pipeline, check its
derived interface fits the binding's role, and resolve its settings against
the collection. This module is the only place that sequence is written;
callers (ingestion, tool invocation, chat setup, prompt rendering, purges,
diagnostics) all go through `resolve_ingest_binding` / `resolve_primary_tool`
/ `resolve_tool_binding` / `resolve_tool_bindings`.

Resolution failures raise `PipelineResolutionError`, never an HTTP exception —
this is a service module, so translating to a status code is the caller's job
(it is an `InvalidInputError`, so routes map it to 400).
