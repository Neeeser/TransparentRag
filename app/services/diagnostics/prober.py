"""Lazy, budget-bounded vector-store probe for collection diagnostics.

Category-C rules ask the live store whether a collection's index exists and
how many vectors it holds. Those probes are the only part of diagnostics that
touches an external system, so they are isolated here: constructed lazily,
share one total time budget per diagnostics request (never per-probe timeouts
that stack), and raise `ProbeUnavailable` on any failure so the rule degrades
to an informational finding instead of sinking the endpoint.
