"""Bounded, durable ingestion queue.

The `documents` table is the queue: a `pending` row is queued work, and the
atomic claim in `run_document_ingestion` (`pending` → `processing`) is what
hands a document to exactly one worker. This module owns the worker pool that
drains it — a fixed-size `ThreadPoolExecutor` started from the app lifespan —
so any number of concurrent uploads never runs more than the configured
number of ingestions at once (issue #138: unbounded background tasks each
holding a DB connection across the embedding HTTP call exhausted the shared
pool, 500ing unrelated requests and stranding documents in `processing`).

Durability comes from the rows, not the executor's in-memory future queue:
`recover()` runs at startup, requeues documents stranded in `processing` by a
crash or restart, and re-enqueues everything `pending`. Re-running a document
from scratch is safe because re-ingestion overwrites the same
`{document_id}:{order}` chunk ids.
