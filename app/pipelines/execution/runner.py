"""Owns the pipeline run lifecycle: run row, trace recorder, and context.

Ingestion and retrieval both need the same four collaborators wired together
for every run: a `PipelineRun` row, a `PipelineTraceRecorder` bound to it, a
`PipelineExecutor`, and the `PipelineRunContext` nodes execute against.
`PipelineRunner` is the one place that creates them, so the two services
don't hand-roll the same bootstrap. Terminal run status is still owned by
`PipelineTraceRecorder` (the executor calls `mark_run_completed`/
`mark_run_failed` on it automatically); callers reach the same recorder
through `PipelineRunHandle.trace` for failures that happen outside of
`execute()` (e.g. persisting results after a successful run).
