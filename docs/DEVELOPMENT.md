# Development Guide

Everything you need to run, test, and contribute to Ragworks. For what the
project *is*, see the [README](../README.md). For binding engineering rules, see
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (repo-wide), [`app/AGENTS.md`](../app/AGENTS.md)
(backend), and [`frontend/AGENTS.md`](../frontend/AGENTS.md) (frontend).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node 22 (pinned in `.nvmrc`)
- Docker (recommended) — `make run`/`make test` start a Dockerized ParadeDB
  database automatically (see [The dev database](#the-dev-database) below)

## The dev database

`make run` and `make test` start the Postgres they need in the background
before running the app. The **recommended path is Docker**: when a Docker
daemon is reachable they bring up `docker-compose.dev.yml` — a ParadeDB
Postgres (`pgvector` + `pg_search`) on host port `54329` — so hybrid/BM25 search
works exactly as it does in the shipped image, while the backend and frontend
still run natively for hot reload. The container hosts both the dev database
(`ragworks`) and the test database (`ragworks_test`), and data persists in a
named volume across restarts. Its port is bound only to `127.0.0.1`, not the
network.

Without Docker they fall back to a **native** Postgres started via `pg_ctl`
(set `POSTGRES_DATA_DIR` or `POSTGRES_START_COMMAND` if it can't find one). Only
`pgvector` is available there — `pg_search` has no Homebrew build, so BM25 and
hybrid retrieval degrade to dense-only with a startup warning; dense search
still works. Prefer the Docker path so you exercise the same search stack the
release ships and the BM25 test suite runs.

Set `DATABASE_URL` (or `TEST_DATABASE_URL`) to point at your own Postgres — an
explicit value is always respected and left unmanaged. The values are
independent: `DATABASE_URL` controls the app run targets and `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
controls the test targets. Docker mode requires a local Docker daemon; with a
remote Docker context, set the appropriate URL explicitly so it is treated as
external instead.

## Setup

```bash
make env       # uv sync --locked + npm install in frontend/
```

No configuration is required — every setting has a working dev default (the
[dev database](#the-dev-database) is provisioned for you, `./storage` for
files, debug mode via `make server`). Provider API keys (OpenRouter, Pinecone)
are configured **per user in the UI**, not in the environment. There are no
env files: the app reads real environment variables only.

Optional overrides (every one has a sensible default):

```bash
JWT_SECRET_KEY=…               # default: auto-generated on first boot, persisted
                               # under the config path (.jwt-secret)
CONFIG_PATH=…                  # small persistent app state (default: ./config)
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # app log level (default: uvicorn's)
DATABASE_URL=…                 # override the dev database (see "The dev database")
TEST_DATABASE_URL=…            # override the test database (see "The dev database")
OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=…   # default: qwen/qwen3-embedding-0.6b
OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL=…        # default: openai/gpt-oss-120b
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=… / OPENROUTER_SITE_NAME=…   # optional attribution headers
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=…          # default: ragworks
PINECONE_REGION=… / PINECONE_CLOUD=…   # defaults: us-east-1 / aws
```

> **`DEBUG` defaults to `false` (secure by default).** An unset JWT secret is
> auto-generated and persisted on first boot; an explicit `changeme` placeholder
> is rejected outside debug mode. Dev entry points opt into debug for you:
> `make server` exports `DEBUG=true`, and the test suite sets it in
> `tests/conftest.py`. CORS origins are settings-driven
> (default `http://localhost:3000`).

## Running

```bash
make run        # backend (:8000) + frontend (:3000) together
make server     # backend only: uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload
make frontend   # frontend only (sets NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL)
```

The startup hook initializes the Postgres schema if it's missing. The frontend
talks to whatever `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` points at (default
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`), so you can point the UI at any FastAPI host without
rebuilding.

## API surface (high level)

| Route | Description |

| `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/token`, `GET /api/auth/me` | Onboarding + JWT auth |
| `GET /api/models` | Cached OpenRouter model catalog |
| `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/collections` | Collection CRUD |
| `POST /api/collections/{id}/documents` | Upload → ingestion pipeline run |
| `POST /api/collections/{id}/query` | Retrieval pipeline run (transparent search) |
| `POST /api/collections/{id}/chat` | Multi-turn chat with tool calling, SSE streaming |
| `GET/POST /api/pipelines`, `POST /api/pipelines/validate` | Pipeline graph CRUD + validation |
| `GET /api/traces/...` | Per-run, per-node execution traces |
| `GET /api/indexes` | Pinecone index management |
| Visualization routes | UMAP projections of chunk embeddings |

## Architecture

Layered, with a strict import direction — never upward:

```
core ← schemas ← db/clients ← domain packages (chat, pipelines, retrieval, visualization) ← services ← api
```

```
app/
  core/          settings + security (JWT, bcrypt)
  schemas/       the wire contract — Pydantic models, one module per domain
  db/            engine/bootstrap/migrations + models/ + repositories/ (per-domain)
  clients/       typed OpenRouter + Pinecone clients
  chat/          chat subsystem: facade, run loop, tools, branching, SSE events
  pipelines/     pipeline engine: nodes, registry, validation, execution, tracing
  retrieval/     pluggable RAG stages: chunkers, embedders, indexers, parsers,
                 rerankers, retrievers
  visualization/ UMAP projection compute + persistence
  services/      business logic + typed domain errors (errors.py)
  api/routes/    thin routes: parse → one service call → translate errors
tests/           mirrors app/ layout (tests/api, tests/services, …)
frontend/
  src/app/       Next.js App Router routes (thin shells)
  src/components/ feature folders (chat-studio/, collections/, pipelines/, ui/)
  src/lib/       api/ (the only place fetch lives), types/ (hand-mirrored wire types)
```

Key invariants (full detail in the AGENTS.md files):

- **Services raise typed domain errors** (`NotFoundError` → 404,
  `InvalidInputError` → 400, `ExternalServiceError` → 502); routes translate
  once via `to_http_exception`.
- **The wire contract is defined once** in `app/schemas/`; frontend types in
  `frontend/src/lib/types/` hand-mirror them and change in the same PR.
- **Pipeline resolution has one home** (`app/services/pipeline_resolution.py`);
  run lifecycle has one owner (`PipelineRunner`).
- **All query logic lives on repositories**; schemas and db models never mix.

## Testing & quality gates

Nothing ships without its gate passing:

```bash
make verify              # backend gate: mypy strict → ruff + pylint → pytest
make coverage            # coverage run (floor enforced; review term-missing)
cd frontend && npm run verify   # frontend gate: tsc → eslint → vitest
make format-check-frontend
```

- The suite runs **without live credentials** against a real Postgres —
  OpenRouter/Pinecone are stubbed at the client boundary.
- Module size is capped at 400 lines, enforced by `tests/test_module_size.py`.
- **Every bug fix ships with a red-green regression test in the same commit.**

## Conventions

- Conventional-commit subjects, scoped: `feat(pipelines): …`, `fix(ui): …`.
- Work on a branch; merge to `main` via PR; one concern per PR.
- Before touching Pinecone/OpenRouter integrations, read the local docs in
  `docs/external-api/` — they match the pinned versions. The directory is
  gitignored; fetch it with `node scripts/download-openrouter-docs.mjs` and
  `node scripts/download-pinecone-docs.mjs`.
- When a fix teaches a rule, add it to the relevant AGENTS.md in the same PR.

## Make command reference

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make env` | Install backend (uv) + frontend (npm) deps |
| `make run` / `make server` / `make frontend` | Run both / backend / frontend |
| `make verify` | Backend gate: typecheck → lint → test |
| `make test` / `make test-frontend` | Backend / frontend tests |
| `make coverage` / `make coverage-frontend` | Coverage (fails on test failure) |
| `make coverage-open` / `make coverage-open-frontend` | Open HTML coverage reports |
| `make typecheck` / `make lint` | mypy strict / ruff + pylint |
| `make lint-frontend` / `make format-frontend` / `make format-check-frontend` | ESLint / Prettier |

## Known gaps (tracked)

- No CI yet — `make verify` / `npm run verify` are discipline-enforced; wiring
  them into GitHub Actions is the highest-value next step.
- Frontend wire types are hand-mirrored; generating from `/openapi.json` via
  `openapi-typescript` would eliminate drift.
- Provider API keys are stored plaintext at rest (wire exposure is guarded by a
  secret-exclusion contract test).
- Document upload has no size/content-type limit yet.
- No E2E test layer (Playwright/Cypress).
