# Edge-safe DAG layout design

## Goal

Make Tidy produce deterministic, readable layouts for arbitrary pipeline DAGs while
ensuring nodes do not overlap and routed edges do not intersect unrelated node cards.
The saved node positions and viewport fitting behavior remain unchanged.

## Constraints

- The algorithm is general and must not inspect pipeline kind, node type, node ID, or
  shipped pipeline identity.
- Layout remains synchronous so existing load, Tidy, trace, and layout-persistence call
  sites keep their current lifecycle.
- Existing semantic edge colors, selection emphasis, validation state, and trace playback
  animation remain intact.
- Layout and routing are deterministic for unchanged node and edge inputs.
- The editor must remain usable for larger graphs without excessive layout time or canvas
  growth.

## Evaluated approaches

### Hybrid layered placement plus obstacle-aware routing (selected)

Retain a small pure TypeScript placement module and use
`@tisoap/react-flow-smart-edge` for orthogonal grid A* routing. The package supports
React Flow 12, is MIT licensed, is current at version 4.13.0, and is approximately
0.88 MB unpacked. Its low-level API lets `TypedEdge` retain Ragworks' visuals and
animation while replacing only path geometry.

This is the narrowest change that can guarantee edge-versus-node safety. React Flow's
endpoint-only smooth-step path cannot account for intermediate node obstacles, and node
placement alone cannot prevent every long edge from crossing a populated intermediate
layer.

### ELK layered layout and orthogonal routing

ELK directly returns node positions and edge bend points and is the strongest integrated
layout engine considered. It is not selected because its JavaScript API is asynchronous,
its unpacked package is approximately 8 MB, and adopting its waypoints would require a
broader editor, load, trace, and persistence lifecycle refactor.

### Custom placement and custom A* routing

A project-owned router would avoid a dependency but would duplicate a difficult geometric
algorithm, including endpoint escape, obstacle inflation, fallback behavior, and
performance tuning. That adds correctness and maintenance risk without product-specific
benefit.

## Placement architecture

`layoutPipelineNodes` remains a pure function returning node copies with new positions.
It will:

1. Filter graph relations to known nodes and discover weakly connected components.
2. Assign each component's nodes to longest-path layers with deterministic ordering.
3. Minimize crossings using alternating forward and backward barycenter sweeps. Stable
   node order is the tie-breaker.
4. Seed each layer as a non-overlapping vertical stack using estimated rendered heights.
5. Repeatedly center nodes toward the average of adjacent predecessors and successors,
   resolving collisions after each sweep while preserving the chosen order.
6. Normalize each component to the origin and pack disconnected components vertically
   with a fixed component gap.

The result centers fan-out branches around their source and merge nodes among all inputs
instead of top-aligning every layer. Longest-path layering keeps edges predominantly
left-to-right and preserves sufficient horizontal clearance for routed bends.

## Routing architecture

`TypedEdge` obtains the current React Flow nodes and calls the router's low-level
`getSmartEdge` API with an orthogonal, non-diagonal pathfinder, a fixed routing grid, and
node padding. Routing is recalculated when React Flow rerenders edges during node movement,
so saved layouts and manual drags do not retain stale waypoints.

If the router cannot find a path, `TypedEdge` falls back to the existing smooth-step path
instead of disappearing. The existing `BaseEdge` styles and animated payload circles use
the selected path unchanged.

## Testing

Pure geometry fixtures cover linear, fan-out, fan-in, diamond, unequal-depth merge,
nested branch/merge, consecutive merges, disconnected components, and the shipped hybrid
topology. Shared helpers calculate estimated node rectangles, route every edge with the
same production routing options, and assert:

- no node rectangles overlap;
- no routed segment intersects an unrelated node rectangle;
- repeated layout returns identical positions;
- a representative larger graph stays within a bounded layout extent and timing budget.

Component coverage verifies `TypedEdge` uses the obstacle-aware path while preserving
semantic styling and animation behavior. The regression suite is run red against the old
top-aligned/smooth-step implementation, then green after the new placement and routing
implementation.

## Visual and accessibility impact

No controls, text, colors, typography, or interaction semantics change. Edge paths gain
extra bends only when required to clear nodes. Light and dark checks confirm semantic
wire colors, contrast, active/error emphasis, and playback dots remain correct.
