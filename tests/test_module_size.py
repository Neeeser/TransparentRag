"""Module-size guard: every module under app/ stays at or under MAX_LINES.

This test is the enforcement mechanism for the grandfathered-oversize-modules
burn-down list described in app/AGENTS.md ("The gate"). The GRANDFATHERED dict
below is the single source of truth for that list: each entry maps a
currently-oversize module to its recorded line-count ceiling. A grandfathered
module may shrink but never grow; once it drops to MAX_LINES or below, its
entry must be deleted (the test fails while a satisfied entry lingers, so the
list can't rot). Phases 2-6 of the backend restructure shrink this dict to
empty — new modules never get added to it.
